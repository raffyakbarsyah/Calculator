#  Calculator (The Odin Project – Foundations Final Project)

This is a **basic calculator web application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, developed as the **final project of The Odin Project Foundations course**.

It supports essential arithmetic operations with interactive UI and user feedback for certain edge case (like divide by zero and digit overflow).

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Basic math operations: `+`, `−`, `×`, `÷`
- ✅ Percentage calculation (`%`)
- ✅ Clear all (`AC`) and backspace (`⌫`)
- ✅ Digit input limit (10 digits)
- ✅ Error messages (e.g., divide by zero, input limit)
- ✅ Styled using pure CSS

## 📸 UI Preview

> Designed with a minimalist aesthetic and green-themed interface.

- Calculator display 
- 4x5 button layout (numbers, operators, control buttons)
- Error messages shown below the buttons
- Fixed footer with my name

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- When a button is clicked, it updates the display accordingly.
- Pressing an operator stores the first number and operator.
- Pressing `=` computes the result.
- Division by zero triggers a warning.
- Input is limited to 10 digits to prevent overflow and ensure clean display.
